## Introduction

The BMP280 is a popular sensor module used in various weather monitoring and environmental sensing applications. It provides precise readings of temperature, pressure, and approximate altitude. This project serves as a basic example of interfacing with the BMP280 sensor and obtaining its data using an Arduino board.

## Features

- Read real-time temperature data in degrees Celsius.
- Read real-time pressure data in Pascals (Pa).
- Calculate and display approximate altitude in meters.

## Hardware Setup

### Components Required

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- BMP280 Sensor Module
- Jumper wires

### Circuit Connection

Connect the BMP280 sensor to the Arduino board as follows:


BMP280   Arduino
  VCC   ->  5V
  GND   ->  GND
  SDA   ->  A4 (on Uno/Nano)
  SCL   ->  A5 (on Uno/Nano)
